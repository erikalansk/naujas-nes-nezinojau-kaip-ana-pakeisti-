            <h3 class="headline">Evolving addiction</h3>
            <p>First, due to the usage of Social media, we become addicted. Social networking site is like an addicting game for users. Once you start using it and getting a positive feedback from your friends or even strangers, you feel the need for constant self-esteem boost. The more response you get from others, the more addicted you get. We anxiously start looking on how many likes we got. Compare ourselves to others, reload our profiles to see what has changed. When time pass, we do all the mentioned things above more frequently.</p>

        <div class="quote_box">“If social media controls you and is robbing you of your freedom and good emotional energy chances are you're addicted and it's time to find another hobby.”<br>

            <h3 class="headline">Fear of being left out</h3>
            <p>The fear of missing on something also plays a huge role on us getting addicted. If everyone else is using social media sites, and if someone does not join in, there’s concern that they will miss jokes, connections, or invitations. Missing experiences can create anxiety and depression. When people look online and see they are excluded from an activity, it can affect thoughts and feelings, and can affect them physically.

                We can become insecure about ourselves. In social media sites and apps, we can see a lot of pictures and videos. This way, people share the moments of their lives. Usually these moments are far from reality. Because people like to brag and paint their life in bright colors without any downsides. And because of that, we start to compare our life, happiness, appearance, monetary status with others. Sometimes comparing oneself to others, can force people change their lives drastically. For example, lose a lot of weight, start taking medicine that is harmful for our bodies.
